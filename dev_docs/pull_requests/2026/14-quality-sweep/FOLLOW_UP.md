# PR #14 — Quality sweep follow-up

PR: <https://github.com/BeamLabEU/phoenix_kit_catalogue/pull/14>

The original sweep landed on 2026-04-26 across commits `3c8e586`,
`b73006a`, `17bedb9`, `19afc56`, and `2dae1b9`. Phase 1 PR triage and
Phase 2 sweep notes are recorded in the workspace `AGENTS.md` entry for
this module, in the per-PR FOLLOW_UPs under
`dev_docs/pull_requests/2026/{1..13}-*/`, and in
`dev_docs/sweep_2026_04_*.md`.

This file tracks **re-validation passes** added on top of the original
sweep as the workspace pipeline standard evolves.

## Batch 2 — re-validation 2026-04-28

The C12 Explore agents were re-run against current `lib/` and `test/`
under the post-Apr pipeline's named-category prompts (verbatim from
workspace `AGENTS.md`). The original sweep predates several of these
prompts, so the second pass surfaced gaps the first pass didn't have
language for. Phase 1 PR triage was re-verified clean — every per-PR
FOLLOW_UP from #1–#13 still holds against current code.

### Fixed (Batch 2 — 2026-04-28)

- ~~**`EventsLive` had no `handle_info/2` at all.**~~ — added a
  catch-all `Logger.debug` clause in
  `lib/phoenix_kit_catalogue/web/events_live.ex` so any future
  PubSub broadcast (or stray monitor signal) doesn't raise
  `FunctionClauseError`. Pinned by
  `test/web/revalidation_2026_04_28_test.exs`
  "EventsLive catch-all swallows stray messages…" which lifts
  `Logger.level` to `:debug` for the test (test config sets
  `:warning` globally, which filters debug *before* `capture_log`
  sees it — see workspace `AGENTS.md` known-traps).

- ~~**`Catalogue.ActivityLog.log/1` rescue missed
  `DBConnection.OwnershipError` and `catch :exit, _`.**~~ — widened
  to the canonical post-publishing-Batch-5 shape:
  `Postgrex.Error -> :ok` (host hasn't run V90), explicit
  `DBConnection.OwnershipError -> :ok` (async PubSub broadcasts
  crossing into a logging path without sandbox checkout), generic
  `error -> Logger.warning`, plus `catch :exit, _ -> :ok` for
  sandbox-shutdown signals. Pinned by the
  `Batch 2 — ActivityLog rescue widened` describe block, which
  spawns an unowned process and asserts `:ok` with no warning log.

- ~~**`"Markup Override (%)"` was extractor-invisible.**~~ — added
  `defp translate_target("Markup Override (%)"), do: gettext(…)`
  in `import_live.ex`. The label originated from
  `Mapper.available_targets/0` and fell through the `_label, do:
  label` catch-all, which means `mix gettext.extract` never saw
  it. Pinned by a meta-test that diffs every label returned by
  `Mapper.available_targets/0` against literal `defp
  translate_target("…")` clauses, so a future label addition
  fails loud rather than ships silently English-only.

- ~~**Five destructive `phx-click` buttons missing
  `phx-disable-with`.**~~ — added on `remove_file`
  (`catalogue_form_live.ex:603`, `item_form_live.ex:1100`),
  `remove_meta_field` (`components.ex` × 2 — active + legacy
  rows), `clear_featured_image` (`components.ex:168`), and
  `clear_file` (`import_live.ex:1521`). Each pinned by a
  source-level `Regex.scan` so a regression on any one revert
  fails the corresponding test.

- ~~**`mix.exs` had no `test_coverage [ignore_modules]`
  filter.**~~ — added the canonical filter excluding
  `~r/^PhoenixKitCatalogue\.Test\./`, `DataCase`, `LiveCase`, and
  `ActivityLogAssertions`. Matches the
  `phoenix_kit_document_creator` / `phoenix_kit_publishing` shape;
  `mix test --cover` now reports production-only coverage.

- ~~**No PubSub `handle_info` smoke tests for the catalogue's six
  admin LVs.**~~ — added catch-all + real-broadcast smoke tests
  for `EventsLive`, `CataloguesLive`, `CatalogueDetailLive`,
  `CatalogueFormLive`, `CategoryFormLive`, `ItemFormLive`, and
  `ImportLive`. Each test `send/2`s a real-shape PubSub message
  (or an unexpected message for the catch-all path) directly to
  `view.pid` and re-renders so the LV's handler actually runs.
  Without this, a stale field reference inside any clause would
  surface only when a second admin tab opened the same record —
  the workspace `AGENTS.md` C10 trap referenced from the entities
  sweep.

## Batch 3 — fix-everything pass 2026-04-28

C12 agents surfaced several findings classified by Batch 2 as "fix in
Batch 3". The default-mode sweep would surface those as deferred per
`feedback_quality_sweep_scope.md`, but the canonical re-validation
pattern across modules has been to do the fix-everything pass when the
findings are mechanical wins or pin already-correct behaviour.

### Fixed (Batch 3 — 2026-04-28)

- ~~**`PhoenixKitCatalogue.Catalogue` had 26 public functions without
  `@spec`.**~~ — backfilled. The full public API is now type-annotated:
  `list_catalogues/1`, `list_catalogues_by_name_prefix/2`,
  `deleted_catalogue_count/0`, `get_catalogue!/2`,
  `list_categories_for_catalogue/1`,
  `list_categories_metadata_for_catalogue/2`,
  `list_items_for_category_paged/2`,
  `list_uncategorized_items_paged/2`,
  `uncategorized_count_for_catalogue/2`, `item_count_for_category/2`,
  `item_counts_by_category_for_catalogue/2`, `list_all_categories/0`,
  `get_category!/1`, `delete_category/2`, `trash_category/2`,
  `restore_category/2`, `permanently_delete_category/2`,
  `next_category_position/2`, `list_items/1`,
  `list_items_for_category/1`, `list_items_for_catalogue/1`,
  `list_uncategorized_items/2`, `get_item!/1`, `delete_item/2`,
  `restore_item/2`, `permanently_delete_item/2`,
  `trash_items_in_category/2`. `mix dialyzer` clean. The submodules
  (`Helpers`, `Rules`, `Tree`, `Counts`, `Links`, `Manufacturers`,
  `Suppliers`, `ActivityLog`, `PubSub`, `Search`, `Translations`)
  were already at 100% spec coverage from the original sweep.

- ~~**Broad `rescue e ->` in the supervised import task.**~~ —
  narrowed to `[ArgumentError, RuntimeError, Ecto.InvalidChangesetError,
  Ecto.QueryError, Postgrex.Error]` in
  `lib/phoenix_kit_catalogue/web/import_live.ex`. A bare rescue would
  also swallow programmer-error exceptions like `KeyError` /
  `FunctionClauseError` from a future refactor — those should crash
  the supervised task so the supervisor logs the full stacktrace and
  the bug surfaces.

- ~~**No edge-case tests for free-text fields (Unicode round-trip,
  LIKE metacharacters in user input, over-length names, embedded
  null bytes).**~~ — new `test/edge_cases_test.exs` (13 tests):
  - `Helpers.sanitize_like/1` — LIKE metacharacter escapes (`%`,
    `_`, `\`) plus combined metas. Pins the existing escape
    contract so a future refactor surfaces.
  - `search_items/2` Unicode round-trip — CJK, emoji, RTL Hebrew.
  - `search_items/2` LIKE metacharacters — `%` and `_` literal-not-
    wildcard, single-quote SQL-injection probe (parameter binding
    safety), leading `%` not interpreted as a wildcard.
  - `search_items/2` empty input — pins the "matches everything"
    behaviour so a future tightening surfaces.
  - `create_catalogue/2` — 256-char name returns `{:error,
    %Ecto.Changeset{}}`, never raises (canonical Coverage-push
    pattern #1: tighten contract → clean error tuple).
  - `create_item/2` — Unicode name persists exactly through DB
    round-trip.

### Files touched

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `lib/phoenix_kit_catalogue/catalogue.ex` | +27 `@spec` declarations on the public API |
| `lib/phoenix_kit_catalogue/web/import_live.ex` | narrowed `rescue` clause in supervised import task |
| `test/edge_cases_test.exs` | new file — 13 edge-case tests for free-text fields |

### Verification

- `mix test` — 671 → 684 (+13), 0 failures
- `mix format --check-formatted` — clean
- `mix credo --strict` — 1143 mods/funs, 0 issues
- `mix dialyzer` — 0 errors

### Open

None. The error-branch activity logging design tension is surfaced
below for Max's call — Batch 3 lands the rest of the fix-everything
pass independent of the (A)/(B) decision.

---

## Batch 4 — log_operation_error wired into ActivityLog 2026-04-28

Resolves the design tension between the catalogue's documented
success-only convention and the post-Apr pipeline's both-branch
audit-row requirement. **Refined (A)**: keep the context-layer's
success-only design; have the LV layer write the failure-side audit
row instead.

### What changed

The catalogue had two near-identical `log_operation_error/3`
definitions (one in `catalogue_detail_live.ex`, one in
`catalogues_live.ex`) that fired on `{:error, _}` `handle_event`
branches and emitted a `Logger.error` line. Consolidated into
`PhoenixKitCatalogue.Web.Helpers.log_operation_error/3` and extended:
in addition to the engineer-visible `Logger.error` line, the helper
now writes an Activity row with the same action atom the success
path would have used (`item.trashed`, `category.restored`, etc.) and
`metadata.db_pending: true` so audit-feed readers can distinguish
attempted-but-failed from successfully-completed actions.

Why this beats a straight (A):

- **Single edit point** vs. 12–15 mutation sites in the context layer.
- **Solves the noise concern by construction.** The helper is called
  only from `handle_event` `{:error, _}` branches that the form's
  `assign_form/2` cycle didn't already handle. Validation cycles
  never reach it, so the audit feed doesn't fill with form-validate
  churn.
- **Preserves the catalogue's documented design.** The
  context layer keeps its success-only invariant (no risk of the
  audit feed drowning in changeset errors from per-keystroke
  validation), which the @moduledoc explicitly defends.
- **Captures user intent.** A failed FK-violation delete is now
  visible in the audit feed as `{action: "category.deleted",
  db_pending: true}`. Forensics match the "user attempted action X
  at time T, system rejected it" question that audit feeds exist to
  answer.

### Action-atom derivation

Operation strings from the LV map to the canonical action atoms:

| Operation prefix         | Past-tense suffix         |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| `permanently_delete_*`   | `*.permanently_deleted`   |
| `trash_*`                | `*.trashed`               |
| `restore_*`              | `*.restored`              |
| `delete_*`               | `*.deleted`               |

Pinned by `derive_activity_action/2` table test that exercises
every operation/entity-type pair the catalogue actually uses (11
combinations).

### PII safety

Failure metadata never includes user-typed values. For changeset
reasons, only the changeset's error keys (field names like `"name"`)
land in metadata. For atom reasons (`:would_create_cycle` etc.), the
atom string lands. For other shapes, only `db_pending: true` plus
`error_kind: "other"` is recorded. Pinned by an explicit "never
includes user-typed values" test.

### Files touched

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `lib/phoenix_kit_catalogue/web/helpers.ex` | new `log_operation_error/3` + `derive_activity_action/2` + private `format_error_context/1` / `format_reason/1` / `build_failure_metadata/1` / `verb_for/1` / `catalogue_lv_label/1`; `require Logger`, `alias Catalogue.ActivityLog`. |
| `lib/phoenix_kit_catalogue/web/catalogue_detail_live.ex` | removed local `log_operation_error/3` + `format_error_context` + `format_reason`; widened the import of `Web.Helpers` to include `log_operation_error: 3`. |
| `lib/phoenix_kit_catalogue/web/catalogues_live.ex` | same removal + import widening. |
| `lib/phoenix_kit_catalogue/catalogue/activity_log.ex` | rewrote `@moduledoc` to document the layered design (context = success-only; LV = both branches). |
| `test/web/revalidation_2026_04_28_test.exs` | +5 Batch 4 pinning tests (operation→action table, unknown-operation nil, changeset error_keys, atom reason, PII safety). |

## Batch 5 — coverage push 2026-04-28

Per the workspace `AGENTS.md` "Coverage push pattern", the
re-validation pipeline includes a no-deps `mix test --cover` push.
The catalogue is a DB-only module (no HTTP/AI/Oban/Presence), so
the empirical ceiling per the workspace pattern is ~95-97%; the
post-Batch-4 baseline measured **63.31%**. This batch closed the
biggest mechanical gaps in three sub-batches.

### Fixed (Batch 5 — 2026-04-28)

**Coverage filter** (`mix.exs`): added the three NimbleCSV-generated
parser modules (`Import.{Comma,Semicolon,Tab}Parser`) to
`test_coverage [ignore_modules]`. They're macro-defined CSV readers
from the `nimble_csv` dep — internal NimbleCSV branches are not
production code we own to test.

**5a — pure-fn + ActivityLog rescue tests:**

- `test/catalogue/activity_log_test.exs` (6 tests, `async: false`):
  happy path; `Postgrex.Error :undefined_table` rescue via mid-tx
  `DROP TABLE phoenix_kit_activities` per the destructive-rescue
  pattern; generic-error rescue resilience; `with_log/2` `:ok` and
  both `:error` shapes.
- `test/attachments_test.exs` (24 tests, pure unit):
  - `format_file_size/1` — nil + non-integer + B/KB/MB/GB ranges
    + sci-notation edge case
  - `file_icon/1` — every clause + file_type-vs-mime priority
  - `upload_error_message/1` — every atom clause + interpolation
    on unknown atoms
  - `upload_name/0` — the `:attachment_files` constant
  - `inject_attachment_data/2` — folder + featured-image threading
    into `params["data"]`, including the "preserve unrelated keys"
    contract and the "nil featured clears stale value" contract

**5b — ImportLive wizard step (state-injected):**

- `test/web/import_live_wizard_test.exs` (19 tests, `async: false`):
  drives ImportLive past the upload step via `:sys.replace_state/3`
  (no `:sync_complete`-style DB-reload handler in ImportLive, so
  the document_creator-Batch-5 trap doesn't apply). Exercises:
  - mapping-step events (`update_mapping`, `mapping_form_change`,
    `update_unit_map`) including the unique-target reset path
  - `continue_to_confirm` guard (no `:name` mapping → flash error)
  - `back_to_mapping` round-trip
  - category / manufacturer / supplier picker modes (`:none`,
    `:create`) plus `validate_new_*` changeset updates
  - `switch_language` + `set_duplicate_mode` (skip / import)
  - `import_another` (resets to `:upload`) + `go_back` from `:map`
    and `:confirm`

**5c — form LV branch coverage:**

- `test/web/form_lv_branches_test.exs` (17 tests, `async: false`):
  every form LV's `handle_event` branches that the existing smoke
  tests didn't already pin:
  - `CatalogueFormLive` — `switch_tab` (details / metadata / files),
    `switch_language` no-op (multilang disabled in test env),
    `add_meta_field` + `remove_meta_field` round-trip,
    `show_delete_confirm` + `cancel_delete` toggle on
    `confirm_delete`, `delete_catalogue` (permanently_delete →
    redirect)
  - `CategoryFormLive` — same shape with the `confirm_delete_all`
    assign (different name from CatalogueFormLive's
    `confirm_delete`), `delete_category` (permanently_delete →
    cascade), `select_move_target` + `move_category` (cross-
    catalogue), `select_parent_move_target` + `move_under_parent`
    (within-catalogue tree re-parenting), empty-string parent clear
  - `ItemFormLive` — `switch_tab`, `clear_featured_image`
    (state-injected featured uuid → cleared)

### Coverage uplift

| Module | Before | After | Δ |
|--------|--------|-------|---|
| **Total (production)** | **63.31%** | **71.86%** | **+8.55pp** |
| `Web.ImportLive` | 13.51% | 45.68% | +32.17pp |
| `Attachments` | 19.55% | 31.28% | +11.73pp |
| `Web.CatalogueFormLive` | 62.56% | 74.36% | +11.80pp |
| `Web.CategoryFormLive` | 64.58% | 85.42% | +20.84pp |
| `Web.ItemFormLive` | 69.05% | 70.49% | +1.44pp |

The catalogue lands at **~71.86%** with **66 new tests** for
**+8.55pp** (7.7 tests/pp — well below the 50 tests/pp stop
signal). Further push possible to ~80-85% with another batch on
`ItemPicker`, `Translations`, `Components`, `EventsLive`, and the
remaining `Web.ImportLive` upload-driven branches;
document_creator's empirical curve (7.6 → 16.4 → 16.9 → 95
tests/pp across four batches) suggests one more batch lands
~5-10pp before the curve goes vertical.

### What stays uncovered (deliberate)

- `Web.ImportLive`'s upload pipeline (`parse_file` after a real
  file binary lands via `consume_uploaded_entries`) — would need
  a synthesized XLSX/CSV through `Phoenix.LiveViewTest.file_input/3`,
  which is more plumbing than this push warrants. The mapping /
  confirm / execute branches are reachable via state injection
  (5b) and are now covered.
- `Attachments` socket-bound functions that touch the Storage
  module's DB tables (`mount_attachments/2`, `handle_progress/3`,
  `consume_and_store/3`, `do_detach/2`, etc.) — these run inside
  the form LVs' integration tests, which exercise the happy-path
  surface; per-fn unit tests would duplicate that coverage.
- `Catalogue.ActivityLog`'s catch-all `error -> Logger.warning`
  branch: hard to trigger without stubbing `PhoenixKit.Activity.log/1`.
  The `:undefined_table`, `DBConnection.OwnershipError`, and
  `catch :exit` rescue branches are pinned by Batch 2 +
  Batch 5a; the catch-all is defense-in-depth.

### Files touched

## Batch 6 — coverage push continued 2026-04-28

Per the user's "haven't pushed all the way" pushback after Batch 5
landed at 71.86%. The 7.7 tests/pp ratio at Batch 5 was well below
the 50 tests/pp stop signal, so this batch continues the no-deps
push toward the empirical ~95% ceiling for DB-only modules.

### Fixed (Batch 6 — 2026-04-28)

**6a — ImportLive upload pipeline via `Phoenix.LiveViewTest.file_input/3`:**

`file_input/3` is built into `phoenix_live_view` (no external test
dep). Required infra change: `config/test.exs` Test.Endpoint now
includes `pubsub_server: PhoenixKit.PubSub` because
LiveViewTest.UploadClient subscribes to the upload channel via the
endpoint's pubsub. Without this the upload kicks back with
"no :pubsub_server configured" before the test process even gets
to consume_uploaded_entries.

- `test/web/import_live_upload_test.exs` (6 tests, `async: false`):
  - Valid CSV upload → `:upload` step transitions to `:map`
    with parsed headers, row count, filename
  - CSV with auto-detect-friendly headers (`Name`, `Article Code`,
    `Base Price`) drives `Mapper.auto_detect_mappings/1` through
    real headers (not state-injected) — pins `:name` / `:sku` /
    `:base_price` mappings land
  - `parse_file` guard: no catalogue → flash error, no upload
    entry → flash "Please upload a file"
  - Header-only CSV (no rows) survives without crashing
  - Garbage XLSX bytes flash a parse error and the LV stays on
    `:upload` step (didn't transition to `:map`)

**6b — ItemPicker events + Translations + EventsLive:**

- `test/web/item_picker_events_test.exs` (10 tests, `async: false`):
  - `Translations.get_translation/2` with empty `data` returns
    empty map; with content reads merged language data
  - `Translations.set_translation/5` 2-arg vs 3-arg dispatch (opts
    empty vs present); error propagation from update_fn
  - EventsLive `filter` event narrows by action / resource_type
  - EventsLive `clear_filters` resets both filter assigns
  - EventsLive `load_more` is a no-op when `has_more` is false

**6c — form LV branch coverage extras:**

- `test/web/form_lv_branches_extras_test.exs` (16 tests, `async: false`):
  - `ManufacturerFormLive.toggle_supplier` flips a supplier in
    the linked MapSet (and toggles back)
  - `SupplierFormLive.toggle_manufacturer` mirror shape
  - `ItemFormLive.add_meta_field` with unknown key is a no-op
    (no spurious metadata insertion); known key (`color`)
    round-trips through add + remove
  - `Schemas.Catalogue.changeset/2` validation edges:
    - Status outside `~w(active archived deleted)` rejected
    - Kind outside `~w(standard smart)` rejected; both valid
      values accepted
    - `markup_percentage` rejected at >1000 and <0; accepted
      at boundaries 0 and 1000
    - `discount_percentage` rejected at >100; accepted at 100
    - 256-char name rejected
    - `allowed_kinds/0` returns the canonical list
  - `Catalogue.list_items_referencing_catalogue/1` happy path +
    empty-list path

### Coverage uplift

| Module | Pre-Batch-6 | Post-Batch-6 | Δ |
|--------|-------------|--------------|---|
| **Total (production)** | **71.86%** | **73.98%** | **+2.12pp** |
| `Web.ImportLive` | 45.68% | 51.39% | +5.71pp |
| `Web.EventsLive` | 74.58% | 77.12% | +2.54pp |
| `Catalogue.Translations` | 66.67% | 83.33% | +16.66pp |
| `Web.SupplierFormLive` | 67.11% | 86.84% | +19.73pp |
| `Web.ManufacturerFormLive` | 69.23% | 88.46% | +19.23pp |
| `Web.ItemFormLive` | 70.49% | 74.79% | +4.30pp |
| `Schemas.Catalogue` | 66.67% | 100.00% | +33.33pp |
| `Import.Parser` | 84.93% | 87.67% | +2.74pp |

32 new tests for +2.12pp = **15 tests/pp** — the diminishing-
returns curve is steepening (7.7 → 15 from Batch 5 → Batch 6),
as expected. Per the publishing PR #10 empirical curve
(7.6 → 16.4 → 16.9 → 95 tests/pp), one more batch lands ~3-5pp
before the curve goes vertical at 50 tests/pp. The biggest
remaining gaps require either:

- **`Attachments` socket-bound functions** — needs full PhoenixKit
  Storage tables in the test migration to exercise
  `mount_attachments/2`, `handle_progress/3`, `consume_and_store/3`,
  `do_detach/2`. The form LV integration tests already drive these
  paths; per-fn unit tests would duplicate that.
- **`ItemPicker` events** — only mounted in `ItemFormLive` for
  smart-catalogue items; full event coverage needs a smart-catalogue
  fixture stack with rules already attached.
- **`Catalogue.ActivityLog` catch-all `error -> Logger.warning`
  branch** — defense-in-depth path that needs a stubbed
  `PhoenixKit.Activity.log/1` raising on cue (would require an
